# Z determination
Repository with analysis of z determination

## Main goal
Provide the calibration method and code to estimate the z coordinate of a cluster/signal from camera-only (maybe in future 3D) info. This also helps the deconvolution of the raw data to recover something which has the diffusion contribution subtracted.

Technique based on track deconvolution and machine learning with attention

## People supervising
